Pipe allows you to deliver real-time livestreams to users across the globe withour worrying about scale. As a developer, Pipe is easy to integrate - there's only 3 steps to getting your first broadcast going.

Before we get started, make sure you obtain a Project Token with "Manage Pipe" permissions from the Console and use it to initialize the Hop SDK.
