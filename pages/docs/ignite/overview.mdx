# Ignite

Ignite was born out of frustration from existing infrastructure solutions which don't quite hit the mark.

- Kubernetes assumes you're running Google out of the box
- Compute resource reservation in the big cloud platforms isn't fine-grained; you're still expected to spin up VMs to host resources
- Cloud platforms charge insane amounts for egress bandwidth
