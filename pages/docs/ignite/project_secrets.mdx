# Project Secrets

Project secrets act as a global secure secret store for each project on Hop. Secrets can be referenced in Ignite deployment configs and will automatically be populated when a container starts.

Secrets can be **created**, **updated** and **deleted** through the API, CLI, SDK or console, however they cannot be viewed.

## Secret Names

Secret names are limited to 64 characters in length, must be alphanumeric (with underscores) and are automatically uppercased.

üìù Secret name regex, for your convenience: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,64}$`

## Creating or Updating a Secret


With the CLI, you can manage secrets with the `hop secrets` command:

```sh
hop secrets set <secret_name> <value>
```

## Deleting a Secret

CLI:

```sh
hop secrets delete <secret_name>
```
