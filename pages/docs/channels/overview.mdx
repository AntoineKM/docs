# Overview

Channels allows you to easily create direct or grouped realtime message channels between users, server-side applications, IoT devices and more.

Channels are feature-rich and can be of multiple different Channel types, Visibility types and have multiple Capabilities enabled, allowing you to create anything from a realtime stock ticker to a fully feature-rich group messaging app.

To use channels, you need a protected server-side application (e.g. an API) which can use the Hop SDK to create [Tokens](#tokens) and Channels. You can then use the client-side SDKs like hop-js to subscribe to channels.

## Concepts

### Clients

The client (or "user") is the entity that subscribes to Channels, using either the Hop SDK or via a custom [Leap](internals/leap) implementation. The client can be anything: a React app, a server-side application or an IoT device, for example.

### Tokens

For a client application to authenticate with Channels, they will need to use a token (`leap_token_xxx`) generated using the Hop API from your backend. You can use the Hop SDK to generate a token with metadata. You are expected to securely hand this token to a client application, which they can then use to authenticate with Channels through the Hop SDK.

If you have a database of users, then you should create a token for each individual user that needs to connect to Channels and store it in relation to their user, then re-use that same token when they need to connect again in the future.

You can connect and authenticate with Channels multiple times under the same token.

### Sessions

When a client SDK connects to the Channels socket, they are given a session. Then, if a user connects multiple times under one token, they are connected to the same session. As a developer, you shouldn't need to worry about this resource - just know that it's used to keep a consistent and uninterrupted socket connection during unstable network conditions. You can read more about it in the [Leap](./leap) documentation.

### Channel Subscriptions

A channel subscription refers to a client token being subscribed to a channel.

When tokens are created, they can be given access to a list of "default channels" which they will automatically get subscribed to when authenticating with the Channels socket. Tokens can also create channel subscriptions while being connected, through the SDK. It's up to you to decide if a token should be granted access to that channel.

You can also force create a channel subscription through the Hop server-side SDK. When created, this will take effect in realtime.

All channel subscriptions are permanent across all sessions, and will last until a token is unsubscribed from a channel through the server-side API or local SDK.

```
                                  ┌──────► channel_0
                                  │
                                  ├──────► channel_1
                                  │
User (Leap Token) ◄───► Session ◄─┼──────► channel_2
                                  │
                                  ├──────► channel_3
                                  │
                                  └──────► channel_4
```

### Channels

By default, channels are direct, private, server->client realtime messaging rooms, however, channels are feature-rich and be of multiple different types, visibility types, and have multiple different Capabilities assigned to them. By default, channels are permanent until you delete them, however for some use cases, it might make more sense to give them the `ephemeral` capability, which makes them automatically delete once all subscribers have disconnected.

Channels are a "cheap" resource to create, meaning you can and should create as many as you need to fulfill the needs of your application or feature.

#### Base Types

#####

#### Visibility Types

Channels can have one of 2 visibility types:

- Private
- Public

**Private** channels allow you to limit access to that channel, either by granting tokens permission or by telling Hop to call an API route you give to us.

**Public** channels allow anyone to join them, given they're authenticated under your project and know the channel ID.

### Messages

You can use the Hop API or SDK to easily send messages of any size to channels.
