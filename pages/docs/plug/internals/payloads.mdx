# Payloads

We split payloads up into 2 categories: **Control** and **Service**. All payloads (from and to Leap Edge) must follow the Leap Edge encapsulating payload type:

### Encapsulating Payload Type

| field | type   | description  |
| ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| op    | number | opcode       |
| d     | object | message data |

**The payloads documented below are defining what goes inside the `d` (data) field.**

## Control

### Opcode 1: Hello
