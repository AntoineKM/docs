# Hop

Welcome to Hop's API documentation.

Interfacing with Hop is possible over our rest API, or with prebuilt SDKs for certain supported languages. These docs cover both our rest API and all server side SDKs. If you are looking for the client documentation (`@onehop/client`, then please visit <Link href="https://js.hop.io">js.hop.io</Link>)
